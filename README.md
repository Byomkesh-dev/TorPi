Requirements
----

- Raspberry Pi (2 or 3).

- You will need two network interfaces on the Raspberry Pi, one for connecting raspberry pi itself to the internet and one wireless interface for sharing the TOR-Tunneled network. Raspberry Pi 3 has Ethernet and WiFi out-of-the-box, so you are good to go, but for Raspberry Pi 2 you will need a USB Wifi dongle.

- MicroSD card (8GB Recommended) with Raspbian image installed.
